# Experimental-Analysis-of-K-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm-Variants-for-Disease-Classification
This repository presents an experimental analysis of various K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm variants for disease classification tasks. The goal is to evaluate the performance of these variants on different disease datasets and identify the most effective approaches for specific scenarios.
Key Features:

Implementation of core KNN algorithm and its variants (e.g., weighted KNN, k-NN with distance weighting, etc.)
Exploration of different distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
K-value optimization techniques
Integration with popular disease datasets (specify the datasets you'll be using)
Performance evaluation using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
Clear and concise code structure for reproducibility
Benefits:

Gain insights into the effectiveness of KNN variants for disease classification
Compare the performance of different variants on various disease datasets
Identify the most suitable variant for your specific disease prediction task
Leverage well-structured code for further experimentation and development
Getting Started:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/knn-disease-classification.git
Install dependencies (refer to a requirements.txt file for Python libraries)
Run the analysis scripts (provide instructions on how to execute the analysis)
Explore and analyze the results (mention the generated outputs, such as plots, tables)
Future Work:

Integration of additional KNN variants
Investigation of ensemble methods to combine KNN with other algorithms
Experimentation with different disease datasets
Deployment of the best-performing model for real-world disease prediction (if applicable)
