# Experimental-Analysis-of-K-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm-Variants-for-Disease-Classification
This repository presents an experimental analysis of various K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm variants for disease classification tasks. The goal is to evaluate the performance of these variants on different disease datasets and identify the most effective approaches for specific scenarios.
